            <span>Our story</span>
            <p>Zinc was conceived in 2015, a product of the frustrations of a career in recruitment. Luke, one of the Founders
                had become disenchanted with the state of recruitment. Increasing competition for attention and an unmatched
                supply of talent meant diminishing results for recruiters. This drew most to data abuse tactics of spam,
                misusing others work identities and falsely phishing for leads. A shift towards platforms empowering workers
                that started to level the playing field had begun. Luke imagined privacy technology to protect workers data
                and allow them to own their work identity. An ecosystem in which workers could interact with companies and
                recruiters fairly was born.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every worker has a right to own their skills and experience data. Nobody should be tied to centralised platforms.</li>
                <li>No worker should be subject to prejudice over age, gender, birthplace or the university they went to. Workers
                    should be judged on their personal attributes and skills.</li>
                <li>Workers should be in control of when they interact with companies and recruiters and not be subject to data
                    abuse.
                </li>
                <li>As a legal right, every worker should have a platform to access and own their work data and control their
                    professional identity.</li>
                <li>In a tokenised world everyone should be rewarded for sharing data.</li>
                <li>Disintermediate for users value but not for disintermediation's sake.</li>
                <li>Build a network and ecosystem around your community.</li>
            </ul>
